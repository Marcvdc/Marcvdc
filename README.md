# 👋 Hi, I'm Marc

Full-stack software developer based in the Netherlands with a strong focus on **Laravel**, **modern frontend stacks**, and **AI-assisted software development**. I build production-grade systems with an emphasis on structure, maintainability, and real-world usability.

I use AI as a **force multiplier**, not a black box: tooling, prompts, and pipelines are designed to be transparent, auditable, and secure.

## 🧠 Areas of expertise

- **Backend**: Laravel, PHP 8+, Filament (admin & internal tooling), REST APIs, domain-driven design
- **Frontend**: Alpine.js, Livewire, Tailwind CSS
- **AI & LLMs**:
  - RAG pipelines (Qdrant)
  - Local & remote LLMs (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Qwen)
  - AI agents for analysis, logging, and decision support
- **DevOps & Infra**:
  - Docker / docker-compose
  - CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
  - Linux servers, systemd, reverse proxies
- **Data & tooling**:
  - PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL)
  - Redis
  - Vector databases
  - Structured logging & observability

---

## 🚀 Current focus

- Building **AI-powered developer and domain tools**
- Designing **plan-first workflows** (docs → constraints → implementation)
- Exploring **local AI hosting** with privacy and compliance in mind
- Turning complex domains into **clear, maintainable software**

## 🧩 Selected projects

### AimTrack  
🔗 https://github.com/Marcvdc/AimTrack

AI-assisted shooting logbook for sports shooters. Focused on structured session tracking, pattern recognition, and actionable feedback — without losing user control over data.

---

### Internal AI Tooling
Private/internal repositories focused on:
- Code review automation
- Release preparation
- Knowledge retrieval (RAG)
- Decision support for complex domains

---

### Monthli  
🔗 https://github.com/Marcvdc/Monthli

A subscription and recurring-revenue platform focused on **clarity, control, and automation**.

Monthli is designed to handle real-world business complexity:
- Subscription lifecycles (start, pause, upgrade, cancellation)
- Recurring invoicing and billing logic
- Integrations with existing financial and operational systems
- Strong internal tooling built with **Filament**
- Emphasis on data correctness, auditability, and maintainability

The platform follows a **domain-driven approach**, where financial logic is explicit, testable, and resistant to edge cases.

---

## 🛠️ How I work

- Prefer **explicit structure** over implicit magic
- Document before building
- Automate what repeats
- Keep humans in the loop

I value code that someone else can understand **six months later**.
